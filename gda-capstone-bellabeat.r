Conclusion and recommendations\n**Act**\n\nIn this study, I focused on sleep and activity. Since sleep is the most important function that affects well-being and health. In this study, I used only the duration of sleep, without analyzing its quality.\n\n- I found that sleep and steps are not significantly related. Although there is a slight tendency that sleep worsens when overtired.\n- But what has a strong effect is a sedentary lifestyle that significantly worsens sleep, after a certain value.\nIn this analysis, we analyzed the steps, but the activity is not determined only by the steps, so in the future it makes sense to check the influences of other activities as well.\n- The most active day of the week in terms of the number of steps is Sunday, but at the same time, this day has the most minutes of a sedentary lifestyle. And the sleepiest day/night is Monday. Probably on this day people close all their debts - someone is more active, someone is resting and getting enough sleep. They are probably different people. That moment should be set aside for further study.\n\n**Recommendations**\n- When developing applications and gadgets that should have a positive effect on sleep and wellness, I recommend taking into account that activity during the day affects sleep, so it is necessary to develop reminders and recommendations to change activity, warm up or reduce activity so that a good sleep awaits the user at night.","metadata":{}}]}
